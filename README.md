🧠 Face Recognition Attendance System

A full-stack attendance system built using Flask (Python),Node JS, MongoDB, and React.js, featuring real-time face recognition for authentic attendance marking.
The backend uses face_recognition for high-accuracy facial comparison and records attendance data in MongoDB.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time webcam capture for live attendance
✅ Strong face comparison using face distance threshold
✅ Secure MongoDB integration for users and attendance logs
✅ Cross-Origin enabled (React ↔ Flask communication)
✅ Stores attendance with name, ID, timestamp, and confidence score
✅ Prevents proxy attendance with strict matching rules
